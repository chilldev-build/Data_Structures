A data structure (DS) is a way of organizing data to be accessed efficiently.
Important to create fast and powerful algorithms. Makes code cleaner and easier to understand.

Abstract data type provides the interface for data adherence.
Does not give details implementation or language.

For example the ADT List could be a DS as a dynamic array or linked list.

Computational complexity analysis:

How much time and how much space does my algorithm take.

Big-O notation - gives upper bound of the complexity in the worst case.
Interested in what happens when input becomes arbitrarily large.

*** Confused a bit about big O - Look this up and create a file specific to this topic.
